# DomoticzZoneMinder
 Manage ZoneMinder Cameras and main states on Domoticz.

Can automaticaly search and add new cameras.
If "no Camera" is set to true, try not to add or maange cameras. Only manage main state.

KNOWN BUG: when detecting cameras for the very the first time, just open one camera on domoticz page et click on update. All other cameras are now working.
